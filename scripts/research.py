"""AutoScout's real-research stage.

The maturation loop used to let the model *narrate* progress ("we tried X,
found Y") with nothing behind the claim — indistinguishable from fabrication.
This stage instead makes the model propose ONE concrete, narrow question
answerable by code, actually RUNS that code in the same sandbox verify.py
uses, and treats only what the script's stdout contains as ground truth.

The model gets exactly one way to report a result: print a line starting
with RESULT_MARKER followed by a single-line JSON object. Anything else it
claims is not trusted. A second, separate call may add prose interpretation,
but sanitize_interpretation() strips any number that doesn't actually appear
in the measured result — the same "don't trust the model to reproduce facts,
verify deterministically" pattern as mature_repo.py's sanitize_log().

If the model can't propose something runnable, a qualitative question is
allowed (per project scope) but is always logged as explicitly unverified —
never presented with the same confidence as a measured result.

The benchmark script itself is committed alongside the log entry, so a
reader can rerun it and check the claim rather than take it on faith.
