"""Frozen eval harness: score-gated maturation.

research.py answers one-off questions. This module answers a standing one:
"did this cycle's change make the repo measurably better or worse?" On a
repo's first cycle with a research key available, the model proposes a
FIXED eval/dataset.json + eval/run_eval.py once; every cycle after, both
files are frozen (see freeze_eval_files()) — the model is never allowed to
rewrite the yardstick it's being measured against, only the code being
measured, regardless of what the prompt asks — freeze_eval_files() strips
any attempted edit to them deterministically, the same "don't trust
compliance" pattern as sanitize_log() and research.py's marker-only trust.

Every pass runs the same eval before and after its edit. A regression on
the deterministic score aborts the push exactly like a verify_with_retries
failure, because a real number going down is not noise. A separate,
non-gating LLM-judge opinion is also collected and logged for context, but
never itself grounds for reverting a change — a judge call has run-to-run
noise a measured score doesn't.
